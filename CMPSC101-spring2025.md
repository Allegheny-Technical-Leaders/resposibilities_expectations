## Expectations for CMPSC 101 Spring 2025

### Lab Attendance

Please attend all labs. If you have a conflict, please let me know as soon as
possible. Try to find another TL who can substitute for you at the lab time.

During lab, you should walk around and talk to students. Make an effort to
check in with students who have not raised their hand as well as those who
have raised their hand.

Please do not leave early. Encourage the students to try to finish the labs
in lab when all resources are available to them.

If students feel they need regular private assistance with assignments, then
they should talk to JJ about getting a tutor.

#### Lab Preparation

Before each lab, look at the materials that have been posted
to be able to refer students to information they already have at their
disposal. Often labs are very similar to examples that have been covered in
class.

### Discord Usage

Please answer student questions on Discord. You can also encourage students
to use good practices on Discord (e.g. markdown code blocks instead of
screenshots).

If students DM you, please tell them to post in the public channel.

### Recording Student Quizzes

Students will take quizzes instead of tests. I ask that you mark and transfer
which questions were correct and incorrect into a Google Sheet weekly.

### Recording Student Participation on Discord

Students are required to use Discord this semester (one time per week). I ask
that you check for meaningful use of Discord by each student and record it into
a Google Sheet weekly. Meaningful use is any question or answer posted that is
real, and exhibits collegiality. "I have the same problem", could be fine if it
is supporting an ongoing conversation, but is considered minimal use. Questions
can be about any of the class materials, not just labs.
